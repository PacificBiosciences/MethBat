# Cell atlases
This folder contains publicly available cell atlases converted to the MethBat format.
While limited testing has been done on each atlas listed here, we recommend additional verification of performance prior to broad implementation.
If you would like to generate your own atlas, refer to our documentation for the [expected MethBat atlas format](../../docs/deconvolution_guide.md#atlas-format).

List of atlas files included:

* [Nanomix atlases](./nanomix) - Atlases released as part of [nanomix](https://github.com/Jonbroad15/nanomix/tree/main/atlases), which were released under the MIT license. The nanomix GitHub does not specify the reference build for these atlases, but it is presumed hg38 from internal testing.

If a public atlas you would like to use is missing, please file a GitHub ticket to investigate inclusion in this list.
