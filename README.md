# MethBat : A battery of methylation tools for PacBio HiFi reads
MethBat will aggregate and analyze CpG methylation calls made from [PacBio HiFi](https://www.pacb.com/technology/hifi-sequencing/) datasets.
Key features include:

* Creation of a methylation profile for a collection of genomic regions (e.g., CpG islands)
* Creation of cohort / background profiles from a collection of methylation profiles
* Analysis of cohort profiles comparing sub-groups (e.g., case v. control, male v. female)
